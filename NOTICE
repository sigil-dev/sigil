Sigil
Copyright 2026 The Sigil Authors

This project was inspired by OpenClaw (https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw),
an open-source personal AI assistant gateway. Sigil began as a conceptual fork
of OpenClaw, reimagined as a Go-native implementation with a security-first
plugin architecture.

We gratefully acknowledge the OpenClaw project and its contributors for
pioneering the personal AI gateway concept and demonstrating the value of
multi-channel AI assistants.

The plugin architecture draws on patterns from HoloMUSH
(https://github.com/holomush/holomush) and HashiCorp's go-plugin library.

The process-tier sandboxing approach is inspired by Anthropic's sandbox-runtime
(https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime).
